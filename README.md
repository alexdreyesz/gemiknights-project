📱 mAInLine: Your AI-Powered Personal Panic Button
A life-saving AI emergency assistant designed to help users get critical medical help—when they can't speak for themselves.

🚨 Inspiration
We were inspired by the Life Alert system and Apple’s SOS feature—both of which aim to save lives, but fall short in accessibility and autonomy. Life Alert requires a paid subscription, limiting access for many, while the iPhone SOS feature only dials 911 without speaking—leaving those unable to talk in danger.

mAInLine solves this. It’s an intelligent mobile panic button that autonomously communicates your emergency to dispatch using real-time AI.

💡 What It Does
mAInLine is a mobile/web application that acts as your AI-powered personal panic button. Here's how it works:

User Onboarding
Users enter:

Full name

Date of birth

Home address

Medical history (e.g., heart/lung issues, allergies)

Emergency Activation
With one tap, the app:

Calls 911 via Twilio

Uses Gemini AI to speak directly to the operator

Shares:

User’s name and age

Real-time location

Access instructions (if provided)

Medical info relevant to the emergency

🔐 Privacy First
We prioritize user safety and privacy. All personal and medical data is handled securely and is only used in case of an emergency.

🧠 Tech Stack
Built with modern full-stack technologies:

Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript

Backend: Node.js, Express

Mobile Integration: Kotlin

Communication: Twilio (for calls/texts)

AI Integration: Google Gemini API

In Progress: Gibberlink integration for encrypted real-time voice links

🧪 Challenges We Faced
Idea Validation: Finding a solution that was both creative and genuinely useful.

AI Integration: Coordinating Gemini with Twilio and backend routing to enable a smooth emergency call experience.

🚀 What’s Next
✅ Finalize the Gibberlink integration

📱 Package the app into a native Android/iOS app

🔒 Harden security & encryption for sensitive data

🔄 Enable real-time updates between user and dispatch

📢 Advocate for adoption as a built-in smartphone feature
